**oxidation and reduction:**

* oxidation is the loss of electrons or gain of H^+^
* reduction is the gain of electrons or loss of H^+^ **redox rules:**
* _rule 1:_
  * substances in the elemental state **but not in a compound** have an oxidation number of 0
    * _e.g._ Cl~~2~~ = 0, C = 0, P~~4~~ = 0
* _rule 2:_
  * monoatomic ions have an oxidation number equal to the charge of the ion
    * _e.g._ Na^+^ = +1, Cl^-^ = -1, Al^3+^ = +3
* _rule 3:_
  * oxygen in compounds has an oxidation number of -2 **except** in peroxides
    * _e.g._ in H~~2~~O~~2~~, H is +1 so O must be -1
* _rule 4:_
  * hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 **except** in metal hydrides
    * _e.g._ in NaH, Na is +1 so H must be -1
* _rule 5:_
  * the oxidation number of all atoms in a neutral molecule must sum to make the charge present on the ion 0
  * atoms that don't appear in the rules can have different oxidation number in different compounds

**making equations:**

* _in neutral conditions:_
  1. write down the oxidant/reductant and what product it forms
  * I~~2~~ → I^-^
  2. balance the atoms undergoing reduction/oxidation
  * I~~2~~ → 2I^-^
  3. balance charges by adding e^-^ where required
  * I~~2~~ + 2e^-^ → 2I^-^
  4. add state symbols to the half equation
  * I~~2 (s)~~ + 2e^-^ → 2I^-^~~(aq)~~
* _in acidic conditions:_
  1. balance the atoms given first
  * Cr~~2~~O~~7~~^2-^ → 2Cr^3+^
  2. add in water molecules to balance the number of oxygen atoms missing
  * Cr~~2~~O~~7~~^2-^ → 2Cr^3+^ + 7H~~2~~O
  * HNO~~2~~ + H~~2~~O → HNO~~3~~^-^
  3. add in H^+^ to balance the number of hydrogen atoms
  * Cr~~2~~O~~7~~^2-^ + 14H^+^ → 2Cr^3+^ + 7H~~2~~O
  * HNO~~2~~ + H~~2~~O → NO~~3~~^-^ + 3H^+^
  4. balance charges by adding electrons to the most positive side of each half equation
  * Cr~~2~~O~~7~~^2-^ + 14H^+^ + 6e^-^ → 2Cr^3+^ + 7H~~2~~O +
  * HNO~~2~~ + H~~2~~O → NO~~3~~^-^ + 3H^+^ + 2e^-^
  5. to make an overall equation, multiply by a factor to make the number of electrons equal and combine
  * Cr~~2~~O~~7~~^2-^ + 14H^+^ + 6e^-^ → 2Cr^3+^ + 7H~~2~~O
  * 3HNO~~2~~ + 3H~~2~~O → 3NO~~3~~^-^ + 9H^+^ + 6e^-^
  * ∴ Cr~~2~~O~~7~~^2-^ + 5H^+^ + 3HNO~~2~~ → 2Cr^3+^ + 4H~~2~~O + 3NO~~3~~^-^
  6. to check, ensure oxidation numbers are equal on both sides

**electrochemical cells:**

* _galvanic cells:_
  * ![](../chemistry/images/image_1.31e2d899.emf)
  * through the salt bridge:
    * anions move into oxidation half-cell
    * cations move into reduction half-cell
  * electrons move through the wire from the anode to the cathode
    * the oxidation half-cell is the anode (-, an ox)
    * the reduction half-cell is the cathode (+, red cat)
  * impacts on cell potential:
    * cell potential will vary depending on the chemistry of the half cells being used, the concentration of dissolved substances, pressure, and temperature
    * under standard conditions of 1 molL-1, 101.3 kPa (1 atm) and 25°C, the cell potential becomes E°
* _standard hydrogen electrode:_
  * ![](../chemistry/images/image_2.0c01a45e.emf)
  * at STP, the standard reduction potential for the reduction of hydrogen ions is zero volts
    * 2H^+^~~(aq)~~ + 2e^-^ → H~~2 (g)~~
  * this 'reference' electrode enables standard reduction potentials to be determined for a range of substances

**electrolysis:**

* _electrorefining:_
  * unlike electrolysis, electrorefining involves the oxidation of the anode itself
  * in electrolysis, the anode is inert, but in this process it is involved in the reaction
    * the anode in electrorefining is made out of the material that is intended to be refined and the cathode can be made out of any highly-conductive substance like graphite and gold
  * ![](../chemistry/images/image_3.8e72333d.emf)
* _electroplating:_
  * involves depositing a thin layer of one metal over another
  * thin metal layer may act as protection for underlying metal or look better

**commercial cells:**

* a primary cell can only be discharged once and can never be recharged with electricity
  * they are easy and cheap to manufacture and use, and an example would be a zinc-carbon cell
* a secondary cell can be discharged and recharged repeatedly using electricity
  * an example would be a lead-acid cell
  * secondary cells are easily reusable as they can be recharged with electricity
* a tertiary cell or fuel cell requires a continuous source of fuel and oxygen in order to sustain a chemical reaction to produce electricity
  * an example would be a hydrogen fuel cell
  * tertiary cells can produce electricity continuously as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied
* _lead-acid batteries:_
  * the lead-acid battery consists of numerous banks of lead and lead dioxide plates in a sulfuric acid electrolyte
  * they are the oldest example of a rechargeable battery (secondary cells)
  * as they are rechargeable, there are two states:
    * _discharging (producing voltage)_
      * ![](../chemistry/images/image_5.553aca21.png)
      * _at the anode:_ Pb\~ (aq)\~ + SO~~4~~^2-^~~(aq)~~ → PbSO~~4 (s)~~ + 2e^-^
      * _at the cathode:_ PbO~~2~~ + 4H^+^ + SO~~4~~^2-^ + 2e^-^ → PbSO~~4~~ + 2H~~2~~O
      * _overall:_ Pb\~(aq)\~ + PbO~~2~~
* _hydrogen fuel cells:_
  * the hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that can operate perpetually because the reactants required for the redox reaction can be constantly replaced
  * the reactions can take place in either an acidic or alkaline electrolyte
  * _in acid electrolyte:_
    * H~~2~~ → 2H^+^ + 2e^-^ E~~0~~ = 0.00V
    * O~~2~~ + 4H^+^ + 4e^-^ → 2H~~2~~O E~~0~~ = +1.23V
  * _in alkaline electrolyte:_
    * H~~2~~ + 2OH^-^ → 2H~~2~~O + 2e^-^ E~~0~~ = -0.83V
    * O~~2~~ + 2H~~2~~O + 4e^-^ → 4OH^-^ E~~0~~ = +0.40
