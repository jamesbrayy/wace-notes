**central limit theorem:**
- the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample means converges to a standard normal distribution for large sample numbers
- if a population parameter is normally distributed, than the central limit theorem can be applied even if n < 30
**confidence intervals:**
- the \_\_% confidence interval calculated means that \_\_% of all confidence intervals calculated will contain the true mean of the population
- if confidence intervals overlap between a statement and the measurement then there is evidence to suggest that at the \_\_% level the statement is true
- a 100% confidence interval is not generally possible as a 100% confidence interval implies finite boundaries while a normal distribution is unbounded
