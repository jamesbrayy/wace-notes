**uniform circular motion:**
- uniform circular motion occurs when a body travels at a constant speed and is constantly accelerating towards the centre curvature
- direction is constantly changing and hence velocity is always changing despite no change in speed
  - 
- the direction of velocity is always tangential to the path of motion, while the direction of acceleration is always perpendicular to the velocity of the body
- ***centripetal force:***
  - centripetal force is the net force directed towards the centre of curvature that keeps an object moving in uniform circular motion
  - it is a description of the direction the net force is acting in and thus should not be drawn on free-body diagrams
  -  $${\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{c}=m{\stackrel{\u20d1}{a}}_{c}=\frac{m{\left|\stackrel{\u20d1}{v}\right|}^{2}}{r}\widehat{\stackrel{\u20d1}{r}}$$
$$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \left|{\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{c}\right|=\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}$$
$$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\frac{{m\left(2\mathit{\pi}rf\right)}^{2}}{r}$$
$$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =4{\mathit{\pi}}^{2}mr{f}^{2}$$
- ***centrifugal force:***
  - centrifugal force is the sensation that a body feels while moving in a circular path due to being in a non-inertial reference frame
  - it is not to be confused with centripetal force or any other force for that matter as it is only a descriptive tool for the physical sensation of centripetal acceleration

**banked curves:**
- for a body travelling at a certain speed, it is possible to bank a curve such that no frictional force between the body and the incline to maintain a stable circular path
  - this can be achieved through allowing the horizontal component of the normal force to provide the centripetal force
- for a curve with optimal velocity of ${v}_{opt}$:
  - if ${v}_{body}>{v}_{opt}$, the required $\left|{\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{c}\right|$ is increased assuming $m$ and $g$ are constant
    - to maintain the ratio of ${v}^{2}:r$, the radius of the path of the body must increase
    - this means there must be friction acting between the body and the slope to keep it from sliding up the incline
  - if ${v}_{body}<{v}_{opt}$, the required $\left|{\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{c}\right|$ is decreased assuming $m$ and $g$ are constant
    - to maintain the ratio of ${v}^{2}:r$, the radius of the path of the body must decrease
    - this means there must be friction acting between the body and the slope to keep it from sliding down the incline
- ***derivation of ***${\bm{v}}_{\bm{o}\bm{p}\bm{t}}$***:***
   $$\mathrm{\Sigma}{\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{y}=m{\stackrel{\u20d1}{a}}_{y}={\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{g}-{\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{ny}$$
$$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{ny}=m\stackrel{\u20d1}{g}$$
  
  
  $$\mathit{\Sigma}{\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{x}=m{\stackrel{\u20d1}{a}}_{c}={\stackrel{\u20d1}{F}}_{nx}$$*
F ⃑\_nx=F ⃑\_c*
  
  
  combining $i)$ and $ii)$:
  
   $$\ \ \frac{m\stackrel{\u20d1}{g}}{\mathrm{cos}\mathit{\theta}}=\frac{m{v}^{2}}{\mathrm{sin}\mathit{\theta}}$$
$$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ {v}^{2}=r\stackrel{\u20d1}{g}\mathrm{tan}\mathit{\theta}$$
$$\therefore {v}_{opt}=\sqrt{r\stackrel{\u20d1}{g}\mathrm{tan}\mathit{\theta}}$$
