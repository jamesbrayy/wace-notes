## full poem

> O me! O life! Of the questions of these recurring,
>
> Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
>
> Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
>
> Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
>
> Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
>
> Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
>
> The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?
>
> &#x20;                                      _Answer._
>
> That you are here - that life exists and identity,
>
> That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.

assonance

* long /ay/ sound d that links "vainly", "crave" "trains", and "faithless" evokes just how long those cynical processions feel
* the proximity of the /f/ to the /ay/ intensifies the effect of each

caesura and enjambment
