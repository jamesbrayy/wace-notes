# the fountainhead

## nutshell

Ayn Rand's 1943 philosophical fiction novel The Fountainhead follows the career of uncompromising architect Howard Roark, whose resistance to moral and aesthetic conformity positions him in perpetual conflict with authority and broader society. The text explores the conditions under which independent reason and integrity can assert themselves against the pressures of a collectivist society, articulating a defence of core objectivist ideals.
