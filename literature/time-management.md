# time management

## reading time + planning:

**9:20 to 9:25** choose and read through close reading
* figure out literal and dominant readings and how they'll be phrased
* decide whether doing an alternate (psychoanalytical/existentialist) reading as well

**9:25 to 9:30** choose essay questions

**9:30 to 9:40** write memorised poem and quotes on planning pages as well as nutshells for each essay

**9:40 to 9:45** 5min close reading planning/intro time, 5min structuring essays

* find and highlight all evidence and allocate it to paragraphs (3 good pieces per paragraph)
* write literal reading in correct format
* then finish off thesis statement

**9:45 to 10:00** plan both essays in detail
