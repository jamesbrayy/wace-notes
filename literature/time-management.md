# time management

## reading time + planning:

**-0:10 to -0:05** read through prose close reading

* figure out literal and dominant readings and how they'll be phrased
* decide whether doing an alternate (psychoanalytical/existentialist) reading as well

**-0:05 to 0:00** choose essay questions

**0:00 to 0:10** write memorised poem and quotes on planning pages as well as nutshells for each essay

**0:10 to 0:15** 5min close reading planning/intro time, 5min structuring essays

* find and highlight all evidence and allocate it to paragraphs (3 good pieces per paragraph)
* write literal reading in correct format
* then finish off thesis statement and write first topic sentence

**0:15 to 0:25** plan both essays in detail

* allocate evidence to paragraphs
* write both introductions

## essays:

**0:25 to 1:15** write first essay

**1:15 to 2:05** write second essay

## close reading:

**2:05 to 2:55** write close reading

## editing:

**2:55 to 3:00** read over stuff / continue close reading if not finished
