## primary evidence

> _**Dysart:**_**&#x20;"In it I'm a chief priest in Homeric Greece. I'm wearing a golden mask, all noble and bearded, like the so-called Mask of Agamemnon found at Mycenae."**

* allusion
  * dysart directly compares himself with agamemnon in his dream sequence, due to the sacrifice of his daughter that he performed for the betterment of others
  * dysart feels the same way about the  treatment of mentally ill children in order to help them fit into society
  * at the end of the sequence the eyes of the mask fill up with blood, links to oedipus with his relentless search for truth

> _**Dysart:**_**&#x20;"Sacrifices to Zeus took at the most, surely, sixty seconds each. Sacrifices to the Normal can take as long as sixty months" \[The natural sound of the pencil resumes. Light changes back.]**

* extended metaphor
  * equates clinical treatment with ancient greek blood sacrifice
  * temporal contrast exposes how modern psychiatry is protracted and insidious, no less violent to individuality

> _**Dora:**_**&#x20;"He saith among the trumpets - "**> \
> &#xNAN;_**Alan \[trumpeting]:**_**&#x20;"Ha! Ha!"**

* dramatic irony
  * dora's interpretation of the passage as a demonstration of god's power starkly contrasts with alan's interpretation of it as a show of the raw power and wonder of the horse; this is evident in his excitement
  * underscores how religious texts are re-encoded by alan's pietry with humorous tension

> _**Alan:**_**&#x20;"…Neckwus begat Fleckwus, the King of Spit! And Fleckwus spoke out of his chinkle-chankle! And he said "Behold - I give you Equus, my only begotten son!"**

* parodic allusion, anadiplosis of sorts
  * irreverent pastiche of the lists of genealogy found in the Bible
  * the “chinkle-chankle” ridicules solemnity, linking christ’s bondage to equus’ harness

> _**Dysart:**_**&#x20;"The Normal is the good smile in a child's eyes - all right. It is also the dead stare in a million adults. It both sustains and kills - like a God."**

* paradox
  * normality permits social order but annihilates spontaneity and individuality
  * critiques psychiatry as an instrument of repression

> _**Dysart:**_**&#x20;"Yet if I don't know - if I can never know that - then what am I doing here? I don't mean clinically doing or socially doing - I mean fundamentally!"**

* rhetorical qustion
  * dysart interrogates the metaphysical basis of his work, not its technical function, dramatising his existential doubt
  * without certainty of value, his role collapses into empty procedure

> _**Dysart:**_**&#x20;"In an ultimate sense I cannot know what I do in this place - yet I do ultimate things. Essentially I cannot know what I do - yet I do essential things. Irreversible, terminal things. I stand in the dark with a pick in my hand, striking at heads!"**

* paradoxical polyptoton&#x20;
  * “ultimate” and “essential” are closely related but not identical
  * the polyptoton highlights both the similarity and distinction, making dysart’s cognitive dissonance  more acute

> _**Dysart:**_**&#x20;"My desire might be to make this boy an ardent husband—a caring citizen—a worshipper of abstract and unifying God. My achievement, however, is more likely to make a ghost!"**

* antithesis
  * emphasises dysart’s despair and the futility of imposing societal or moral ideals onto human nature

## general essay framework

### introduction:

* Peter Shaffer's 1973 tragic drama Equus captures the nuanced intersection of contemporary spiritual alienation and raw, untamed emotion, as paediatric psychiatrist Martin Dysart endeavours to understand the disturbing case of 17-year-old Alan Strang, whose pious turned violent fascination with horses prompts an unwelcomed confrontation with the spiritual vacuity of his own 'normal' existence.
