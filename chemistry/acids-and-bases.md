# acids and bases

***

## **theories**
#### *arrhenius theory*
  - an acid has an h in its formula and dissolves in water to form hydrogen ions, $$\mathrm{H}^{+}(aq).$$
    - *e.g.* $$\mathrm{HNO_3}(aq) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}(aq) + \mathrm{NO_3}^{-}(aq)$$
  - a base has an oh in its formula and dissolves in water to form hydroxide ions, $$\mathrm{OH}^{-}(aq).$$
    - *e.g.* $$\mathrm{Ca(OH)_2}(s) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + 2\mathrm{OH}^{-}(aq)$$
#### *davy theory*
  - an acid is a substance that reacts with a metal to produce hydrogen gas
#### *brønsted lowry theory*
  - an acid donates a proton, $$\mathrm{H}^{+}$$
  - a base accepts a proton, $$\mathrm{H}^{+}$$
  - brønsted-lowry acids and bases cannot exist in isolation
    - if an acid donates a proton, it must donate it to a base and vice versa

## **electrolytes**
- substances that dissociate/ionise in water to form a solution that conducts electricity
- there are strong electrolytes which completely dissociate in water and exist as ions in solution
  - $$\mathrm{NaCl}(s) \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}(aq) + \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(aq)$$
  - dissociation involves two ions splitting into two separate ions
- there are also weak electrolytes which partially ionise in water and exist as both molecules and the composite ions of the molecule in solution
  - $$\mathrm{NH_3}(aq) + \mathrm{H_2O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH_4}^{+}(aq) + \mathrm{OH}^{-}(aq)$$
  - ionisation involves a non-ionic molecule splitting into ions

## **hydrolysis of salts**
- salts are strong electrolytes and so they completely dissociate into ions
  - *e.g.* $$\mathrm{Na_2CO_3}(s) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Na}^{+}(aq) + \mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}(aq)$$
- it is then possible for some ions to undergo a further reaction with water
  - *e.g.* $$\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}} + \mathrm{H_2O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO_3^{-}} + \mathrm{OH^{-}}$$
#### *neutral salts*
  - neutral salts will contain the negative ion from a strong monoprotic acid
  - ions like $$\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$$ and $$\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}$$ will not undergo hydrolysis
  - cations of group 1 and 2 metals will not hydrolyse in water
#### *basic salts*
  - the negative ion that is the conjugate base of a weak acid such as the ethanoate ion, $$\mathrm{CH_3COO^{-}},$$ or $$\mathrm{HCO_3^{-}},$$ undergo hydrolysis to make a basic solution
    - $$\mathrm{CH_3COO^{-}} + \mathrm{H_2O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH_3COOH} + \mathrm{OH^{-}}$$
    - the formation of the hydroxide ion produces a basic solution
- *acidic salts:*
  - the cation of the conjugate acid of a weak base, such as the ammonium ion, $$\mathrm{NH_4^{+}},$$ produces an acidic solution
    - $$\mathrm{NH_4^{+}} + \mathrm{H_2O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH_3} + \mathrm{H_3O^{+}}$$

## **pH**
- water will self-ionise and undergo the following equilibrium reaction:
  - $$2\mathrm{H_2O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq) + \mathrm{OH^{-}}(aq)$$
- $$K_w = [\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}][\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$
  - at 25°C, the value of $$K_w$$ is $$10^{-14}$$
- if the temperature of water increases, the self-ionisation of water increases
  - $$\text{heat} + \mathrm{H_2O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(aq) + \mathrm{OH^{-}}(aq)$$
    - endothermic as $$\Delta H > 0$$, leading to an increase in $$[\mathrm{H}^{+}]$$ and $$[\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$ and thus also in $$K_w$$
    - as $$\mathrm{pH} = -\log_{10}[\mathrm{H}^{+}],$$ this causes an increase in measured pH at neutral

## **buffers**
- buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of an acid or base are added
#### *addition of $${H_3}O^+$$*
  - on addition of $$\mathrm{H_3O^{+}},$$ the concentration of $$\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}$$ increases
  - this increases the rate of the reverse reaction as there is an increase in the frequency of collisions between products
  - this means more products are consumed than produced and this decreases the concentration of $$\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}$$ until equilibrium is reestablished so only a small increase in the concentration of $$\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}$$ occurs
  - as $$\mathrm{pH} = -\log_{10}[\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}],$$ pH only decreases slightly
  - $$\text{base} + \mathrm{H_3O^{+}} \rightarrow \text{conjugate acid} + \mathrm{H_2O}$$
#### *addition of $$OH^-$$*
  - $$\mathrm{OH^{-}}$$ reacts directly with the weak acid when added
  - $$\text{weak acid} + \mathrm{OH^{-}} \rightarrow \text{conjugate base} + \mathrm{H_2O} \quad (\text{equilibrium shifts left})$$
  - this causes a slight decrease in the concentration of $$\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}$$ as the equilibrium shifts a small amount to the left
  - as $$\mathrm{pH} = -\log_{10}[\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}],$$ pH only increases slightly

## **ocean issues**
#### *reactions*
  1. $$\mathrm{CO_2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO_2}(aq)$$
  2. $$\mathrm{CO_2}(aq) + \mathrm{H_2O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H_2CO_3}(aq)$$
  3. $$\mathrm{H_2CO_3}(aq) + \mathrm{H_2O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO_3^{-}}(aq) + \mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq)\quad (K_1 = 2.50\times10^{-4}\ \text{at }25^\circ\mathrm{C})$$
  4. $$\mathrm{HCO_3^{-}}(aq) + \mathrm{H_2O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}(aq) + \mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq)\quad (K_2 = 4.69\times10^{-11}\ \text{at }25^\circ\mathrm{C})$$
#### *ocean acidification*
  - le châtelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions, the system will adjust to re-establish equilibrium in such a way as to partially counteract the imposed change
  - an increase in concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide would cause equilibrium 1 to shift to the right as it dissolves into the seawater, increasing $$[\mathrm{CO_2}(aq)]$$
  - this increase causes equilibrium 2 to shift to the right and increase $$[\mathrm{H_2CO_3}(aq)]$$
  - by equilibrium 3, $$\mathrm{H_2CO_3}(aq)$$ can be ionised to form hydrogen carbonate and hydronium ions. as $$[\mathrm{H_2CO_3}(aq)]$$ is increased the concentration of both of these substances is also increased
  - as $$\mathrm{pH} = -\log_{10}[\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq)],$$ this increase in $$[\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq)]$$ results in a decrease in pH and hence an increase in acidity of seawater
#### *shell thinning*
  - because $$K_3$$ is much larger than $$K_4,$$ equilibrium 3 lies much further to the right than equilibrium 4 and thus $$[\mathrm{HCO_3^{-}}(aq)]$$ is much larger than $$[\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}(aq)]$$ and $$[\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq)]$$
  - as ocean acidification increases the concentration of $$\mathrm{H_3O^{+}}(aq)$$ ions in seawater, equilibrium 4 is driven towards the left causing a decrease in $$[\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}(aq)]$$ in seawater
  - due to this, the calcification process is slowed as less carbonate ions are being deposited in the shells of marine animals, causing them to grow thinner and less protective shells
