**theories:**
- *arrhenius theory:*
  - an acid has an H in its formula and dissolves in water to form hydrogen ions, H^+^ (aq).
    - *e.g.* HNO~3 (aq)~ → H^+^~ (aq)~ + NO~3~^\-^~ (aq)~
  - a base has an OH in its formula and dissolves in water to form hydroxide ions, OH^\-^~ (aq)~.
    - *e.g.* Ca(OH)~2 (s)~ → Ca^2+^~ (aq)~ + 2OH^\-^~ (aq)~
- *davy theory:*
  - an acid is a substance that reacts with a metal to produce hydrogen gas
- *brønsted lowry theory:*
  - an acid donates a proton, H^+^
  - a base accepts a proton, H^+^
  - brønsted-lowry acids and bases cannot exist in isolation
    - if an acid donates a proton, it must donate it to a base and vice versa

**electrolytes:**
- substances that dissociate/ionise in water to form a solution that conducts electricity
- there are strong electrolytes which completely dissociate in water and exist as ions in solution
  - NaCl~ (s)~ → Na^+^~ (aq)~ + Cl^\-^~ (aq)~
  - ==dissociation involves two ions splitting into two separate ions==
- there are also weak electrolytes which partially ionise in water and exist as both molecules and the composite ions of the molecule in solution
  - NH~3 (aq)~ + H~2~O~ (l) ~⇌ NH~4~^+^~ (aq)~ + OH^\-^~ (aq)~
  - ==ionisation involves a non-ionic molecule splitting into ions==

**hydrolysis of salts:**
- salts are strong electrolytes and so they completely dissociate into ions
  - *e.g.* Na~2~CO~3~ → 2Na^+^ + CO~3~^2-^
- it is then possible for some ions to undergo a further reaction with water
  - *e.g.* CO~3~^2-^ + H~2~O ⇌ HCO~3~^\-^ + OH^\-^
- *neutral salts:*
  - neutral salts will contain the negative ion from a strong monoprotic acid
  - ions like Cl^\-^ and NO~3~^\-^ will not undergo hydrolysis
  - cations of group 1 and 2 metals will not hydrolyse in water
- *basic salts:*
  - the negative ion that is the conjugate base of a weak acid such as the ethanoate ion, CH~3~COO^\-^, or HCO~3~^\-^, undergo hydrolysis to make a basic solution
    - CH~3~COO^\-^ + H~2~O ⇌ CH~3~COOH + OH^\-^
    - the formation of the hydroxide ion produces a basic solution
- *acidic salts:*
  - the cation of the conjugate acid of a weak base, such as the ammonium ion, NH~4~^+^, produces an acidic solution
    - NH~4~^+^ + H~2~O ⇌ NH~3~ + H~3~O^+^

**pH:**
- water will self-ionise and undergo the following equilibrium reaction:
  - 2H~2~O~ (l) ~⇌ H~3~O^+^~(aq)~ + OH^\-^~(aq)~
- K~w~ = \[H~3~O^+^\]\[OH^\-^\]
  - at 25°C, the value of K~w~ is 10^\-14^
- if the temperature of water increases, the self-ionisation of water increases
  - heat + H~2~O~ (l) ~⇌ H^+^~ (aq)~ + OH^\-^~ (aq)~
    - endothermic as ∆H > 0, leading to an increase in \[H^+^\] and \[OH^\-^\] and thus also in K~w~
    - as pH = -log~10~ \[H^+^\], this causes an increase in measured pH at neutral

**buffers:**
- buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of an acid or base are added
- *addition of H**~3~**O**^+^**:*
  - on addition of H~3~O^+^, the concentration of H~3~O^+^ increases
  - this increases the rate of the reverse reaction as there is an increase in the frequency of collisions between products
  - this means more products are consumed than produced and this decreases the concentration of H~3~O^+^ until equilibrium is reestablished so only a small increase in the concentration of H~3~O^+^ occurs
  - as pH = -log~10~ \[H~3~O^+^\], pH only decreases slightly
  - base + H~3~O^+^ → conjugate acid + H~2~O
- *addition of OH**^\-^*
  - OH^\-^ reacts directly with the weak acid when added
  - weak acid + OH^\-^ → conjugate base + H~2~O (equilibrium shifts left)
  - this causes a slight decrease in the concentration of H~3~O^+^ as the equilibrium shifts a small amount to the left
  - as pH = -log~10~ \[H~3~O^+^\], pH only increases slightly

**ocean issues:**
- *reactions:*
  - 1\. CO~2 (g) ~⇋ CO~2 (aq)~
  - 2\. CO~2 (aq)~ + H2O~(ℓ) ~⇋ H~2~CO~3 (aq)~
  - 3\. H~2~CO~3 (aq)~ + H~2~O~(ℓ) ~⇋ HCO~3~^\-^~(aq)~ + H~3~O^+^~(aq)~ (K~1~ = 2.50 x 10^\-4^ at 25°C)
  - 4\. HCO~3~^\-^~(aq)~ + H~2~O~(ℓ) ~⇋ CO~3~^2-^~(aq)~ + H~3~O^+^~(aq)~ (K~2~ = 4.69×10^\-11^ at 25°C )
- *ocean acidification:*
  - le châtelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions, the system will adjust to re-establish equilibrium in such a way as to partially counteract the imposed change
  - an increase in concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide would cause equilibrium 1 to shift to the right as it dissolves into the seawater, increasing \[CO~2 (aq)~\]
  - this increase causes equilibrium 2 to shift to the right and increase \[H~2~CO~3 (aq)~\]
  - by equilibrium 3, H~2~CO~3 (aq)~ can be ionised to form hydrogen carbonate and hydronium ions. as \[H~2~CO~3 (aq)~\] is increased the concentration of both of these substances is also increased
  - as pH = -log~10~\[H~3~O^+^~(aq)~\], this increase in \[H~3~O^+^~(aq)~\] results in a decrease in pH and hence an increase in acidity of seawater
- *shell thinning:*
  - because K~3~ is much larger than K~4~, equilibrium 3 lies much further to the right than equilibrium 4 and thus \[HCO~3~^\-^~(aq)~\] is much larger than \[CO~3~^2-^~(aq)~\] and \[H~3~O^+^~(aq)~\]
  - as ocean acidification increases the concentration of H~3~O^+^~(aq)~ ions in seawater, equilibrium 4 is driven towards the left causing a decrease in \[CO~3~^2-^~(aq)~\] in seawater
  - due to this, the calcification process is slowed as less carbonate ions are being deposited in the shells of marine animals, causing them to grow thinner and less protective shells
